        "The Maldives are known for their natural environment including the blue ocean, white beaches, and clean air. The climate is ideal for visitors to get engaged in water sports such as swimming, fishing, scuba diving, snorkeling and water-skiing.",
    "Iceland":
        "Widely known as “The Land of Fire and Ice”, Iceland is home to some of the largest glaciers in Europe, and some of the world’s most active volcanoes. Iceland is also the land of light and darkness. Long summer days with near 24-hours of sunshine are offset by short winter days with only a few hours of daylight.",
    "Hawaii":
        "From sandy beaches with emerald-blue water and palm trees under tranquil skies to the rugged, black shoulders of volcanoes that continue to reshape the earth, the Hawaiian Islands teem with diversity. Beyond the terrain itself, the islands present a bedazzling variety of plants, animals and people.",
    "Ireland":
        "They call Ireland the “Emerald Isle” for a reason. The country is filled with rich greenery and stunning geography. Ireland is home to the second highest cliffs in Europe; the Croaghuaun on Achill Island. Besides its landscape, Ireland is known for its beers, one of which is the famous Guiness."
